#### How to override style in NativeBase?

<div id="faq-5" class="panel-collapse collapse">
    <div class="panel-body">
        I didn't find a way to override style. <br />
        How can I include React StyleSheet into my app?
    </div>
    <br />
    <div class="panel-footer">
        <b> Solution: </b><br />
        <a href="http://nativebase.io/">NativeBase</a> is built on top of <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/">React Native</a>.<br />
        Hence with any component you can pass the style property which will be merged to the default style of that component.<br />

        Example:
        <pre><code class="language-jsx">&lt;Button style=&#123;{backgroundColor: '#FF0000'}}>
        Click me!&lt;/Button></code></pre>
    </div>

<a id="add-events"></a>
#### How do I add events with the components?

<div id="faq-6" class="panel-collapse collapse">
    <div class="panel-body">
        What events are available for the components?<br />
        Example buttons, list items etc.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div class="panel-footer">
        <b>Solution:</b> <br />
        The <a href="http://nativebase.io/">NativeBase</a> components are built on top of <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/">React Native</a> components. Hence the callback events of React Native holds good with NativeBase components. <br />

        <i>Example:</i> The <code>Button</code> component is actually a wrapper of the <code>TouchableOpacity</code> component of React Native. So you can just use the <code>onPress</code> callback function for event handling.<br /><br />

        Refer the
        <a href="">cheatsheet</a>
        for more details.

#### How to customize components of NativeBase?

<div id="faq-8" class="panel-collapse collapse">
    <div class="panel-body">
        I didn't find a way to customize the default styles of NativeBase components. <br />

    <div class="panel-footer">

<a id="list-icons"></a>
#### I want list of icons with their names used in NativeBase

<div id="faq-9" class="panel-collapse collapse">
    <div class="panel-body">
        Docs says <b>Choose from 700+ Icons</b><br />
        I want the complete list of icons containing the name and image of the icons that are ready to use.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div class="panel-footer">
        <b> Solution: </b><br />
        NativeBase use Icons from <a href="https://expo.github.io/vector-icons/">React Native Vector Icons</a>.<br />
        Hence the collection of icons from Vector Icons holds good with that in NativeBase.
