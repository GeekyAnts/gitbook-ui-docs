# Theming Your App

* The theme has categorized its screens into different sections.

### Change App Icon

With [CRNA](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) Changing the app icon is much easier than the usual React Native App. You just need to give local path or remote url of an image you want to use as app icon to the **[icon](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v15.0.0/guides/configuration.html#icon)** attribute in app.json.



### Rename App

Renaming any [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app) is very easier.
You just need to rename **[name](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v15.0.0/guides/configuration.html#name)** attribute in package.json.


### Changing the URL name for publishing with Expo

* To change the App name for the Expo url, you just need to rename the **[slug](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v15.0.0/guides/configuration.html#slug)** attribute in app.json file.
